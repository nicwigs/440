# Perceptron-Models
Author: Sari Saba-Sadiya

For students in cse440 introduction for artificial intellegence, spring 2019.

As seen in class, the perceptron is a simplified model of a biological neuron that can learn to perform classification tasks. While relatively simple, these classifiers perform surprisingly well even on non-trivial tasks such as hand written digit recognition.

This assignment will walk you through the implementation and testing of a multiclass perceptron classifier.
